## FAQ


1. **Why do I need a GUI builder?**

2. **Do I need to purchase a license to use this?**

3. **How does this compare to other UI builders?**

   **A.** 
   * Most GUI builders out there are framework specific, this UI Builder tool is framework independent.

   * This outputs code in Python, not in XML or other formats which can be hard to debug. So its easier to modify even after downloading the code.

   * Support for 3rd party UI libraries. Many GUI builders don't come with support for 3rd party libraries. 

4. **Why doesn't the theme of the GUI builder match the theme of Tkinter?**
   
   **A.** Tkinter is a OS-dependent library, so it would render differently on different OS. Having a common UI the the GUI builder makes it simpler for development. 
   
   If you want a live preview before generating the code you can get a premium license and you'll be notified when that feature releases.
